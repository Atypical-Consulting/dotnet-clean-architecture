- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

You can expect an initial response within 48 hours. We will work with you to understand and address the issue before any public disclosure.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions. We recommend always using the latest version.
